# Programming-Basics
This repository contains jupyter notebooks that teach the basics for programming in python 3. Club members with little or no programming experience should access this. More experienced members that wish to brush up on basic programming skills should access this as well. 

The following notebooks were written by Joseph Tadros during the Summer of 2017: Numbers, Strings, Lists, Tuples, Sets, Operators, Statement_Syntax, If_Else_Elif_Statements, For_Loops, While_Loops, List_Comprehensions, Functions, Lambda_Functions. Edits may have been made by other club members since the initial upload. Also, additional notebooks may have, and hopefully have been, been made and uploaded to this collection of jupyter notebooks.
