    "In order to play, run all of the cells, and then type **game_start()** in an empty cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outline of the program is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Game start function\n",
    "        a. Print Rules\n",
    "        b. Ask for the two players names'\n",
    "        c. Tells the players if they will be X or O\n",
    "        d. Prints the empty board\n",
    "        e. Go to function for player1's choice\n",
    "    2. player1's move function\n",
    "        a. Gives player a choices for where he can place an X\n",
    "        b. Asks player where he would like to place his X\n",
    "        c. If X is not placed at one of the given choices, ask player once again where he would like to place his X\n",
    "        d. If X is placed at one of the given choices, update the board to have an X at that choice\n",
    "        e. Take away that choice so it cannot be used again\n",
    "        f. check if win, if not check if board is full, if not go to player2 move\n",
    "        g. if board is full, it is a tie\n",
    "        h. if win, player 1 wins.\n",
    "    3. player2's move function\n",
    "        a. same thing as player1's move function except with player 2 stuff"
