    "# Lambda Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, we can create these cool things called **lambda functions**. These are also called *anonymous functions*, because they do not need to be bound to a name. So what are the differences between a regular function and a lambda function? A big difference is that while a function can take a block of statements, a lambda function will only take one expression. Furthermore, lambda functions do not require **return** statements. The single expression of the lambda function will always be returned. Therefore, you can think of the body of a lambda function as what you would put in the return statement of a regular function.\n",

    "The syntax for a lambda function is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**lambda** parameter(s): expression\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at some examples of lambda functions. We will create a lambda function that will multiply numbers by 2. However, first we will create a regular function that does the same thing to allow for comparison between the two."

    "If you don't understand what is going on, don't freak out...it's a bit tricky and I will do my best to break it down. First, we start of by defining a function called **make_multiplier()**. This function takes in one parameter, **x**. There is also only one statement to this function, and it is a return statement that returns a lambda function! The lambda function also takes in only one parameter, **y**. Being that we are returning a lambda function, when we assign the **make_multiplier()** function to a variable, what we are actually doing is assigning the lambda function that is being returned. So when we are assigning **make_multiplier(2)** to **doubler**, what we are actually doing is assigning **doubler** the lambda expression **lambda y: 2*y**. Similarly, **tripler** will be assigned **lambda y: 3*y**, and quadrupler will be assigned **lambda y: 4*y**. Therefore, doubler, tripler, and quadrupler are now there own functions that take in a single parameter, **y**, and multiply **y** by 2, 3, or 4, respectively. We see proof of that in the last cell which prints **doubler(4), tripler(4), quadrupler(4)** and the output gives us **8**, **12**, and **16**.\n",

Also, it has been 7 years since that movie came out, and I still don't understand it, but I digress...ANYWAY, just like we can have nested if statements and loops, we can have nested lambda functions. Again, I will provide an example of this, and then we will break it down. I encourage you to try and understand the example by yourself before reading the explanation."

The outer lambda function takes two parameters, **F** and **y**. The inner lambda function multiplies **y** by **F(x)**. This implies that **F(x)** will be its own function. Within the next cell we create the functions to be used for **F(x)**, and we call them **Function1** and **Function2**. **multiply_function** takes in three parameters, **F**, **y**, and **x**. In the next two cells, we can see how we supply these parameters. I made it obvious as to which parameters will take on what values by using equal signs within the parameter calls. This is not necessary, but was only done in order to make this example easier to understand. **F** will take one of the functions made, either **Function1** or **Function2**, being that they both use the parameter **x**. Then, I supplied 2 random numbers for **y** and **x**. \n",

However, in the future I, or another club member, may add to this collection and make a notebook on these three functions.
